## Features 

**Grimoire is like a web site builder for data analysis.**

You can mix and match individual components to create your own workflow or use predefined templates.     
Each component is referred to as a spell, while a collection of spells is a Grimoire.    
Spells are made up of python code integrated with Streamlit to provide user interaction.
